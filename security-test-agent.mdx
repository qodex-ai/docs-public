title: "Security Test Agent"
---

The **Security Test Agent** in [Qodex.ai](http://Qodex.ai) helps you automatically test your APIs for security risks — no manual scripting required.

## How to use:

### From AI Agent chat:

- Type: _“Run OWASP Top 10 tests on my APIs”_
- Or: _“Test login flow with security checks”_

### **From Test Scenarios:**

- When creating a new test, add:

  _“Include security tests”_
- Or add **OWASP tests** to any existing scenario

## What the Security Agent tests:

- OWASP Top 10 API vulnerabilities (BOLA, Broken Auth, Injection, etc.)
- Token abuse
- Broken access control
- Rate limiting
- Data leakage
- Misconfigurations

## Why use it:

- Automates security test coverage — no need to write separate security tests
- Catches issues before pentests or production
- Runs continuously — not just once a year
- Keeps security tests versioned alongside your functional tests

## Where to see results:

- Build Reports
- Dashboards
- Slack / Email Alerts
