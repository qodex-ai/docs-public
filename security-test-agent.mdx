title: "Security Test Agent"
---

The Security Test Agent is your AI-driven OWASP and security testing assistant — built directly into Qodex.

It can generate 50\+ different security test scenarios across all endpoints, including:

- Broken Access Control (BOLA)
- Broken Auth & Session Management
- Excessive Data Exposure
- Injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL, Command)
- Insecure Deserialization
- Rate limiting / DoS checks
- Mass Assignment
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfigurations
- Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

## How To Use

- In AI Agent chat → prompt: **_“Run OWASP Top 10 on my APIs”_**
- Or when creating any scenario → **_“Test this endpoint for security flaws”_**

## Benefits

- No security engineering required
- Works across all endpoints (public & private)
- Helps catch common issues BEFORE production
- Keeps OWASP Top 10 coverage up to date as APIs change
- Complements your functional test coverage

## Best Practices

- Run security scans early in staging
- Schedule full OWASP test runs weekly
- Use alerts to monitor for new vulnerabilities as APIs evolve
