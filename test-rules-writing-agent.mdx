title: "Test Rules Writing Agent"
---

The **Test Rules Writing Agent** helps you define how each test should validate the API response — so you can catch failures and security issues automatically.

### How to use:

1. In any **Test Scenario** → open a test case
2. Scroll to **Test Rules** section
3. Choose:
   - **Suggested Rules** (AI will suggest common checks)
   - Or **Write Your Own**:
     - In plain English (AI converts to JS)
     - In JavaScript (full control)
     - As **DB Validation** (checks backend data after API runs)

### Common rules:

- Status code should be 200
- Response should contain field user_id
- Response time under 500ms
- Token must be valid
- Missing auth should return 401
- Database record should match response

### Why use it:

- Automate your test validations
- Catch regressions and bugs early
- Test API responses _and_ backend state
- Works for functional and security testing
