title: "Auto-Healing Agent"
---

The **Auto-healing Agent** keeps your test scenarios in sync as your APIs change — so you don’t waste time fixing broken tests.

### How it works:

- **When you run tests, Qodex detects if:**
  - API responses have changed (fields added/removed)
  - Status codes are different
  - Tokens or flows are updated
- **If a change is detected:**
  - The test will fail
  - You’ll see a **“Fix Me”** button in **Build Reports**
  - Clicking **Fix Me** will auto-update the test rules or request data
  - You can re-run the test immediately

### Where to use:

- In **Build Reports** after any failed run
- Works with manual, scheduled, and CI/CD runs

### Why use it:

- Keeps test suites up to date — no stale tests
- Reduces maintenance overhead
- Helps prevent false failures after intentional API changes
- Saves dev and QA time across fast-moving APIs
