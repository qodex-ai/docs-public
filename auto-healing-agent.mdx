title: "Auto-Healing Agent"
---

The Auto-Healing Agent in [Qodex.ai](http://Qodex.ai) is designed to keep your test suite healthy and aligned with your APIs as they evolve.

**In modern development, APIs are constantly changing:**

- Response structures evolve
- New fields are added
- Status codes or messages shift
- Authentication flows get updated

Without auto-healing, these changes would cause test failures, leading to brittle pipelines and constant manual rework.

## How Auto Healing Works

When you run tests in Qodex:

- The platform detects mismatches between your **test rules** and the **current API behavior**
- If a test fails due to a change (e.g., status code updated, response structure modified), Qodex will:
  - Capture the difference
  - Present detailed Failure Analysis and Recommendations
  - Offer a **Fix Me** option so you can auto-update the affected test rule or scenario

You stay in control — Qodex will not silently update tests — instead, it allows you to review and confirm changes before applying them.

## Benefits of Auto Healing

- Keeps your test suite aligned with real-world API behavior
- Reduces manual effort required to maintain tests
- Helps avoid CI/CD failures caused by expected changes
- Provides traceability — you can view what changed and why
- Improves test reliability and reduces false positives

## How to Use it

- When a test run detects a mismatch:
  - The Failure Report will display **Recommendations**
  - You can click **Fix Me** to automatically update the test scenario
  - Changes will be versioned (if syncing with GitHub)
- This works for:
  - Status codes
  - Response bodies
  - Assertion mismatches
  - DB Validation mismatches (if enabled)

## Best Practices

- Run full test suites after API changes or new deployments
- Review and confirm “Fix Me” suggestions regularly
- Sync test updates to GitHub so your team sees the history
- Use in combination with Scheduled Test Plans — Qodex will alert you when drift is detected
