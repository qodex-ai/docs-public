title: "Slack / Email Alerts"
---

Qodex can notify your team instantly when tests run — so you’re always aware of:

- New test failures
- API regressions
- Flaky tests
- Auto-healed tests
- Coverage changes

**Types of alerts:**

- Full test run summary (success or failure)
- New failures since last run
- “Fix Me” actions performed
- Coverage dropped below threshold
- Flaky tests detected

**Where alerts can go:**

- Slack (to any public or private channel)
- Email (to one or more recipients)
- Webhook (for integrations with tools like PagerDuty, Microsoft Teams, etc.)

## How to set up Slack/Email Alerts:

1. Go to **Test Plans**
2. Create or edit a Test Plan
3. In the Plan **Details tab**, scroll to **Notifications**
4. Add:
   - Slack channel
   - Email addresses
   - Webhook URL (optional)
5. Save the Plan — Qodex will now send alerts automatically on every run

## Benefits of Slack/Email Alerts:

- Keeps your entire team in the loop — in the tools they already use
- Catches regressions early (before they reach production)
- Helps developers act fast (you don’t have to check Build Reports manually)
- Gives QA and platform teams better visibility across environments
- Provides traceability — alerts link directly to Build Reports
