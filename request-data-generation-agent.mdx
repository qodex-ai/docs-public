title: "Request Data Generation Agent"
---

The Request Data Generation Agent helps you quickly build out full request payloads for any test case — with minimal manual input.

When creating a test scenario (either through the AI Agent or manually), you can trigger the agent to:

- Auto-fill request method (GET, POST, etc.)
- Populate path and query parameters
- Add necessary headers (auth tokens, content-type)
- Generate request body (JSON, XML, form-data)
- Handle dynamic variables (IDs, tokens, timestamps)

## How To Use

- In any Test Scenario → click **Create Request Data** (top-right) or just write to the agent to "create request data"
- The agent will examine your API definition and generate a request
- If needed, it will prompt you to provide additional values (like tokens or user IDs)

## Benefits

- Saves time — no need to copy/paste from Postman
- Ensures correct format and field population
- Handles environment-specific variables
- Makes tests ready to run instantly

## Best Practices

Use this feature when adding new endpoints, or when working with APIs that have evolving schemas — Qodex will always generate the latest request format
