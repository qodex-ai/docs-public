The **Request Data Generation Agent** helps you quickly generate complete request payloads for your test cases — so you can run tests without manually writing requests.

### How to use:

1. Inside any **Test Scenario**
2. Click **Create Request Data** (top-right)

### What happens:

- Qodex will generate:
  - HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
  - URL (with path and query parameters)
  - Headers (auth tokens, content type, etc.)
  - Request body (JSON or other formats)

### Alternate way:

- You can also trigger Request Data generation in **AI Agent chat** while creating scenarios:

  _“Generate request data for user creation”_

### Why use it:

- No need to manually build requests
- Ensures correct format and fields
- Works with variables and environment settings
- Keeps request data aligned with your APIs as they evolve
