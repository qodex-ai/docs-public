[**Qodex.ai**](http://Qodex.ai) is an **AI-powered API testing and security platform** built for modern development teams — so you can move fast without sacrificing quality or coverage.

Most teams today struggle with API testing because:

❌ Tests are slow to write and maintain

❌ Security checks happen too late

❌ Tests break when APIs change

❌ It’s hard to scale testing across microservices

**Qodex fixes this.**

## What makes Qodex different?

- **AI-first approach** — no scripting required
- **Auto-discovery of APIs** — even without a complete OpenAPI spec
- **Plain English test creation** — tell Qodex what to test
- **Automatic security coverage** — OWASP Top 10 built-in
- **Tests evolve with your APIs** — no more stale tests
- **Integrated with GitHub & CI/CD** — for full automation
- **Real-time alerts & dashboards** — catch problems before they reach production

## Core Philosophy

Qodex is designed to:

✅ **Shift testing earlier** in your development workflow

✅ **Remove bottlenecks** for engineering, QA, and security teams

✅ **Increase API coverage** while reducing manual effort

✅ **Keep tests current** as your product evolves

✅ **Make security testing automatic** — not an afterthought

## Who uses Qodex?

Qodex works well for:

- **Engineering teams** who want to test APIs without spending days writing scripts
- **QA teams** who need broader test coverage with fewer resources
- **Platform teams** who want API testing as part of every deploy
- **Security teams** who need to validate OWASP Top 10 consistently

## What can Qodex test?

- REST APIs
- GraphQL APIs (coming soon)
- Internal APIs (behind auth)
- Microservices across environments
- Auth & token flows
- OWASP Top 10
- Business-critical user journeys
