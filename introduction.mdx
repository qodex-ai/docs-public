API testing shouldnâ€™t slow your team down. But for most engineering orgs, it still does.

Security checks are delayed. Test coverage is spotty. And writing or maintaining test scripts manually? Itâ€™s a pain.

Thatâ€™s why we built [**Qodex.ai**](http://Qodex.ai) â€” an AI-powered API testing and security platform that helps you **auto-discover APIs**, **generate test scenarios in plain English**, and **catch issues early** â€” before they hit production.\
\
ðŸ‘‰ [**Explore the full Qodex documentation here**](https://docs.qodex.ai/) to get started.

## What's Qodex.ai?

Qodex is your AI QA engineer â€” working 24/7 to:

- Instantly understand your APIs (no OpenAPI spec needed)
- Turn plain-English prompts into functional \+ security test cases
- Auto-heal test scenarios when your APIs change
- Push clean test code to GitHub
- Alert you when tests fail (via Slack, Email, or Webhooks)

Whether youâ€™re launching a new product or scaling a microservices architecture, Qodex is designed to **make API testing effortless, accurate, and scalable**.

## Core Features (With Documentation Links)

- [**Chat-Based Test Generation**](https://docs.qodex.ai/chat-agent-test-generation)

  Start a chat with our AI agent and describe what you want to test â€” Qodex turns it into working, version-controlled test cases.
- [**Import API Collections**](https://docs.qodex.ai/collections/importing-api-collections)

  Upload your Postman or Swagger files â€” or auto-discover your APIs with our SDK. No spec file? No problem.
- [**Scheduling, Reporting, & Integration**](https://docs.qodex.ai/automation/test-plans)

  Run tests daily, weekly, or on every deploy. View full build reports, and plug into your CI/CD seamlessly.
- [**Automated Test Scenario Generation**](https://docs.qodex.ai/scenarios/test-scenario-creation#ai-based-test-generation)

  Functional. Regression. OWASP Top 10. Generate dozens of test scenarios in a single click.
- [**System Health Monitoring & Alerts**](https://docs.qodex.ai/monitoring/monitoring-and-alerts)

  Track API uptime and test status across environments, and configure proactive alerts for your team.

## Test Smarter. Stay Secure.

Qodex goes beyond basic testing. It deeply understands your endpoints and helps you simulate real-world scenarios â€” including:

- Broken access control
- Auth logic flaws
- Token misuse
- Edge case validation
- OWASP Top 10 issues

## Why Teams Use Qodex

- Replace Postman for testing (while keeping the collections)
- Shift-left security with automated test generation
- Eliminate test rot with auto-healing test cases
- Collaborate across dev, QA, and security without silos
- View editable test code, sync it with GitHub, and run it anywhere

## **Why Qodex is Different**

Most testing tools are built for manual testers. Qodex is built for modern engineering teams.

It brings security and functional testing into your workflow early, automatically, and without effort. No delays. No maintenance hell. Just complete coverage, delivered by AI.
