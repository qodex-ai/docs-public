title: "Test Scenario Creation Agent"
---

The Test Scenario Creation Agent is the core of how [Qodex.ai](http://Qodex.ai) helps you move from API definitions to actionable tests. It uses AI to translate natural language prompts into complete test scenarios — with request data, chaining, and validation logic.

**Rather than manually writing test scripts, you simply tell Qodex what to test. The agent will:**

- Break the request into multiple test cases
- Detect and model dependencies between API calls
- Suggest positive, negative, boundary test cases
- Handle chaining and prerequisites
- Generate both functional and security tests

## How to Use the Test Scenario Creation Agent

From the AI Agent chat (default landing page), simply describe the test you want to create.

**Example prompts:**

- Test login flow with valid and invalid credentials
- Verify onboarding process for new users
- Check token expiration and re-authentication
- Run OWASP tests on all protected routes

You can also request tests for specific endpoints or flows.

**The agent will analyze the endpoints and generate a set of test scenarios automatically. You can:**

- Approve and Save
- Edit or refine the scenarios
- Add or remove test cases
- Adjust chaining or dependencies

## What the Agent Generates

When you save a test scenario created by the agent, Qodex will:

- Generate a **test scenario** (group of test cases)
- Auto-populate **request data**
- Set up **test rules**
- Detect required **prerequisites** (login, token generation, object creation)
- Chain API calls together if needed
- Tag the scenario for future reuse

## Key Features

- Works across any imported collection (Swagger, Postman, or discovered APIs)
- Understands auth flows and token handling
- Supports CRUD, flow-based, and edge-case testing
- Suggests positive, negative, and boundary tests
- No duplication — remembers previous test cases
- Can generate OWASP security tests in the same flow

## Where can you use it

- AI Agent chat (create tests from scratch)
- Test Scenarios page → Add New Test Scenario → Create with AI
- Anytime you select an endpoint, you can prompt the agent to suggest tests

## Best Practices

- Be specific in your prompts — e.g., “Test user registration with missing email” will yield better results than “Test user”
- For complex multi-step flows, describe the full flow and Qodex will auto-chain calls
- Save frequently used scenarios to Suites and Plans for easier automation
- Combine functional test prompts with OWASP prompts to get both types of coverage
