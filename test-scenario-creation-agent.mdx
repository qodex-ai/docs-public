title: "Test Scenario Creation Agent"
---

The **Test Scenario Creation Agent** lets you build complete test scenarios by simply describing what you want to test — no scripting needed.

### How to use:

1. Go to **AI Agent** (default page at app.qodex.ai/ai-agent)
2. In the chat, type what you want to test:

### Examples:

- _Test login flow with valid and invalid credentials_
- _Verify user registration and token generation_
- _Run OWASP Top 10 tests on my APIs_

### What happens:

- Qodex will:
  - Identify relevant endpoints
  - Create a **Test Scenario**
  - Auto-chain API calls (if needed)
  - Generate **Request Data**
  - Suggest **Test Rules** and **DB Validations**

### Next steps:

- Review the generated test
- Save the scenario
- It will appear in **Test Scenarios** — ready to run manually or in CI/CD

### Alternate way:

- You can also trigger AI test generation from **Test Scenarios** → **Add New Test Scenario** → **AI Mode**
