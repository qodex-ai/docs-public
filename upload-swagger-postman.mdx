### **If you already have a Swagger or Postman collection:**

1. Go to **AI Agent**
2. Top-left dropdown → **Add Collection**
3. Upload:
   - swagger.json or swagger.yaml
   - postman_collection.json

### Alternate Way:

- You can also upload a collection from the **Test Scenarios** tab → left sidebar → **Collections** → **\+ Add Collection**

### Once Uploaded:

- Qodex will parse endpoints, methods, auth patterns
- It will prepare your API collection for:
  - Test generation
  - OWASP security testing
  - API monitoring
