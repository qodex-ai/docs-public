title: "Syncing Tests to GitHub"
---

Qodex allows you to sync all tests to your GitHub repo — so they live in version control along with your source code.

## How to sync:

1. Go to **Test Scenarios**
2. Click **Sync to GitHub**
3. Select target branch and repo
4. Tests will be pushed to /tests/qodex/ folder

## Contents of Synced folder:

- YAML files for each test scenario
- JS files for test rules and DB validations
- Supporting files for local and CI/CD execution

## Why Sync:

- Review test changes with standard Git workflows (PRs, reviews)
- Collaborate across engineering, QA, and platform teams
- Maintain audit trails for test suite evolution
- Track test changes alongside product changes

## Once Synced:

- Every test scenario is versioned in Git
- You can see exactly what changed in each commit (diffs)
- You can revert to previous versions if needed
- You can branch test development (feature branches, experiments)
- Test changes follow your code branching model (dev, staging, prod)

**This ensures:**

- Tests stay aligned with your evolving APIs
- Regression is visible — if coverage drops or test rules change
- No surprises in CI/CD — tests in Git are what runs in pipelines
