Qodex works with:

- GitHub Actions
- Jenkins
- CircleCI
- GitLab CI

**Example GitHub Actions step:**

```yaml
- name: Run Qodex Tests
  run: qodex test run --env=.env.staging

- Automates API testing for every commit
- Helps enforce quality gates on staging & prod
- Detects regressions early in the pipeline
- Prevents untested APIs from reaching production
