title: "Request Data Generation (AI + Manual)"
---

Qodex makes request data generation fast and simple:

## For any Test Case:

1. Click **Create Request Data** (top-right of test case)
2. The AI will generate:
   - HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
   - Full request URL (with path \+ query params)
   - Headers (authorization, content type)
   - Request body (JSON or other format)
3. You can edit the generated data as needed — the platform supports full manual edits:
   - Modify field values
   - Add or remove fields
   - Insert variables from previous steps

## Benefits:

- Saves time — no need to manually type requests
- Ensures request format matches the current API spec
- Helps validate complex requests with dynamic values
- Makes tests stable even when APIs change
