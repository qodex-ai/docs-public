title: "Test Rules Writing (AI-suggested & Manual)"
---

Test Rules define how Qodex will validate test results.

## You can write tests in two ways:

1. **AI-Suggested**
   - Based on your API \+ test case, Qodex suggests relevant checks:
     - Status code is correct
     - Response contains required fields
     - Response time is within limits
     - Tokens are valid or expired as expected
     - Error codes are correct for negative cases
   - You can accept, edit, or delete suggested rules
2. **Manual Rules**
   - You can write rules in:
     - Plain English (AI converts to JavaScript)
     - JavaScript for full control
     - DB Validation: Check backend DB state after API runs

## Benefits:

- No coding required for common checks
- Full flexibility when needed
- Works with complex nested fields and arrays
- Lets you validate both API responses and system state
