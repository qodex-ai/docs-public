title: "Chaining API Calls"
---

Many test scenarios require chaining multiple API calls to simulate a real user flow.

## Examples:

- Login → Get Token → Call Authenticated API
- Create Object → Update Object → Delete Object
- User Registration → Email Verification → Login

## In Qodex, you can:

- Let the AI agent auto-detect when chaining is needed
- Or set up chaining manually:
  - Select prerequisite calls for each test step
  - Pass variables (tokens, object IDs) between steps automatically
  - Validate end-to-end behavior

## Benefits:

- Simulate real user flows
- Detect regressions across multiple API calls
- Validate data consistency across chained APIs
- Works with both functional and security tests
