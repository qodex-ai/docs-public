title: "Running Tests from the Qodex Web App"
---

This is the simplest way to run tests manually from the Qodex UI.

## Steps:

1. Go to the **Test Scenarios** or **Test Suites** tab
2. Select one or more test cases (or entire suite)
3. Click **Run**
4. Choose the environment:
   - Default
   - Staging
   - Production
   - QA
5. Monitor the test run live:
   - The **Build Tab** shows real-time test results
   - The **Build Reports** tab stores historical test runs

## When to Use It:

- To validate new or edited test scenarios
- To do manual checks after API changes
- To run quick sanity checks on environments
