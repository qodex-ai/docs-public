title: "API Discovery Agent"
---

The API Discovery Agent in [Qodex.ai](http://Qodex.ai) helps you quickly map and import your APIs, so you can start generating test scenarios without needing a complete or perfectly maintained API spec.

Many teams struggle with incomplete or outdated documentation — Qodex solves this by providing an agent that:

- Parses and analyzes Swagger, Postman, or live APIs
- Identifies endpoint relationships and dependencies
- Tags endpoints by authentication requirements
- Creates an internal API collection used by the AI agents for test generation

## How API Discovery works?

You can bring APIs into [Qodex.ai](http://Qodex.ai) in three ways:

### Upload API Collection (Swagger or Postman)

- Go to the AI Agent page
- Use the dropdown in the top-left corner → “Add Collection”
- Upload one of the following formats:
  - swagger.json or swagger.yaml
  - postman_collection.json

The API Discovery Agent will analyze:

- Endpoints and methods
- URL patterns
- Authentication
- Parameters
- Expected responses

### Auto-discover from code using the Qodex SDK

If you do not have a ready Swagger or Postman file, you can generate one live by using the Qodex Discovery SDK:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qodex-ai/swagger-bot/refs/heads/main/run.sh -o script.sh && chmod +x script.sh && ./script.sh --project-api-key YOUR_PROJECT_KEY
```

This will:

- Scan your backend
- Generate a complete Swagger spec
- Automatically import it into Qodex
- Map relationships between APIs and identify auth flows

Frameworks supported:

- Node.js / Express
- Ruby on Rails
- Python (Flask / FastAPI)
- Other REST frameworks

## Select from an Existing Collection

If you’ve already imported APIs previously, simply select from your list of existing collections:

- Go to the AI Agent page
- Top-left dropdown → select collection

This makes it easy to re-use collections across projects.

## Why use the API Discovery Agent?

- Quickly onboard APIs without spending weeks writing a spec
- No dependency on static or out-of-date documentation
- Automatically updates when new endpoints are added (re-run SDK)
- Provides full context to Qodex’s AI agents for better test generation
- Enables automated detection of:
  - Auth flows
  - Relationships between objects
  - Common parameters
  - Potential security issues

## Best Practices:

- The more live API examples provided, the better the AI performs during test generation
- Run the SDK again when your backend evolves — tests and coverage will auto-update
- If uploading Postman collections, include environment variables so the Discovery Agent can map them for test generation
