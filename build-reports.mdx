title: "Build Reports"
---

Every time you run tests in Qodex — manually, on schedule, or via CI/CD — a **Build Report** is generated.

This gives you full visibility into test results across your APIs, environments, and timeframes.

## What Build Reports include:

- Overall summary:
  - Total test scenarios run
  - Number passed
  - Number failed
  - Number skipped
  - Time taken per test
  - Environment tested (staging, prod, etc.)
- Scenario-level detail:
  - Pass/fail status for each test scenario
  - Grouped by Suite (if applicable)
  - Linked back to the test case
- Test case details:
  - Request sent (method, URL, headers, body)
  - Response received
  - Response time
  - Test Rules applied
  - Pass/fail for each rule
  - DB Validation results (if used)
  - Error messages or diffs (when failures occur)
- “Fix Me” options:
  - If a failure is due to an API change (not a bug), Qodex will suggest an automatic fix and offer a **“Fix Me”**button
  - Clicking “Fix Me” auto-updates the test logic to match the new behavior
- History:
  - You can view Build Reports across multiple runs — compare regression trends and track test reliability over time

## Where to find Build Reports:

- **Build Reports** tab in the main navigation
- Linked directly from Slack/email notifications
- Auto-generated on every test run — no extra setup required

## Why Build Reports matter:

- Gives you full test visibility — not just pass/fail but “why”
- Makes debugging faster — request \+ response \+ validation in one place
- Helps track regression trends and coverage over time
- “Fix Me” reduces time wasted on maintaining tests after API changes
