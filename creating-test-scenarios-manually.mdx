title: "Creating Test Scenarios Manually"
---

You can also build test scenarios manually — for full control.

## Steps:

1. Go to **Test Scenarios** tab (in the header of [app.qodex.ai](http://app.qodex.ai))
2. Click **Add New Test Scenario** → **Create Manually**
3. Define:
   - **Scenario Name**
   - **API Collection** to use
   - One or more **API Endpoints**
4. For each test case, you can:
   - Add request data manually, or use AI to generate it
   - Define **Test Rules** (AI-suggested or manual)
   - Chain API calls as prerequisites
   - Add DB validation logic if needed
5. Save the scenario — it will be ready to run in-app or via CI/CD

## Manual creation is useful when:

- You want full control over test logic
- You are testing highly specific business rules
- You need complex data setups
- You want to combine tests with manual data validation steps
