## **How to Run OWASP Top 10 Tests**

You can trigger OWASP testing in two ways:

### From AI Agent:

1. Go to **AI Agent**
2. Type a prompt like:
   - _“Run OWASP Top 10 on my APIs”_
   - _“Test for common API security issues”_

The AI will analyze your endpoints and generate security-focused test scenarios automatically.

## What Qodex Tests - OWASP Coverage

 1. **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)**
    - Tests whether users can access or manipulate other users’ data.
 2. **Broken User Authentication**
    - Tests for weak, missing, or improper authentication controls.
 3. **Excessive Data Exposure**
    - Detects overexposed fields or sensitive data in API responses.
 4. **Lack of Resource & Rate Limiting**
    - Tests for missing rate limits and possible DoS vectors.
 5. **Broken Function Level Authorization**
    - Checks whether restricted functionality is exposed to unauthorized users.
 6. **Mass Assignment**
    - Tests whether APIs accept or process unexpected fields.
 7. **Injection Attacks**
    - SQL, NoSQL, command injection testing on inputs.
 8. **Security Misconfiguration**
    - Validates security headers, error responses, CORS, etc.
 9. **Improper Assets Management**
    - Tests for exposed, deprecated or unprotected API versions.
10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**
    - Ensures errors, unauthorized access, and abuse attempts are properly logged.

## Why Automate OWASP Testing?

**Without automation:**

- Many teams only test OWASP risks during annual penetration tests.
- API security gaps can slip through staging and into production.
- It’s hard to maintain security coverage across fast-changing APIs.

**With Qodex:**

- OWASP tests run continuously — in every test cycle or CI/CD run.
- Failures are surfaced immediately (Slack, Email, Build Reports).
- “Fix Me” can auto-heal test scenarios when APIs change.
- Your team gains constant visibility into API security posture.

## Best Practices:

- Run OWASP Top 10 tests on all new API collections.
- Add OWASP tests to critical user journeys (auth, payments, PII).
- Schedule full OWASP test runs weekly in **Test Plans**.
- Monitor coverage and trends in Dashboards and Build Reports.
