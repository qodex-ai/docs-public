title: "Penetration Tests"
---

[Qodex.ai](http://Qodex.ai) helps teams prepare for and complement **formal penetration tests** — by providing **continuous, automated security testing** that runs throughout the development cycle.

Many teams today only conduct penetration testing (pentests) once or twice per year — often after a release, or for compliance requirements (SOC2, ISO 27001, PCI, HIPAA).

But APIs evolve rapidly — and security gaps can emerge at any time between pentest cycles.

## How Qodex Compliments Penetration Testing

- Runs **OWASP Top 10 tests** continuously — not just once per year
- Auto-generates security tests for **new endpoints** as APIs evolve
- Surfaces **token abuse, auth flaws, data leakage** before production
- Provides detailed **Build Reports** that can be shared with pentesters or auditors
- Maintains **audit logs** for all security tests run
- Tracks **coverage trends** — so teams can prove that new APIs are tested
- Detects and alerts on **regressions** that would otherwise go undetected between pentests

## Benefits for Security and Compliance Teams

- Prepares your APIs for formal penetration testing — fewer last-minute surprises
- Reduces “gap windows” between annual or quarterly pentests
- Helps prove to auditors that **API security testing is part of your SDLC**
- Surfaces issues earlier — enabling faster remediation
- Provides artifacts for:
  - SOC2
  - ISO 27001
  - GDPR / CCPA
  - HIPAA
  - PCI DSS

## Typical Workflow

1. Use Qodex to run **continuous OWASP tests** (daily/weekly) on staging
2. Before a formal pentest, export Build Reports for review
3. After pentest, use Qodex to validate remediation
4. Keep security tests running in CI/CD to monitor for regressions
