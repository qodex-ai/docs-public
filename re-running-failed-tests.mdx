title: "Re-running Failed Tests"
---

**When tests fail, Qodex helps you quickly diagnose and update them:**

1. Go to **Build Reports** → Open any failed run
2. You’ll see failed tests, along with a **“Fix Me”** option (if the failure is due to an API change)
3. Click **“Re-run Failed”** to only run the failed tests again
4. Use **“Fix Me”** to auto-update tests when APIs have changed (status codes, response fields, tokens, etc.)

## Benefits:

- Speeds up debugging
- Keeps your test suite aligned with evolving APIs
- Reduces noise in CI/CD
- Makes it easy to maintain coverage
