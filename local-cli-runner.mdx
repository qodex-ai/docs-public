Developers can also run Qodex tests locally â€” for debugging or during feature development.

## Steps:

1. Sync tests to GitHub
2. Clone repo locally
3. Set up .env for your environment (staging, dev, prod)
4. Run from terminal:

```bash
qodex test run --env=.env.staging
```

## Use Cases:

- Debug a failing test locally
- Validate a new test scenario before pushing
- Reproduce CI/CD failures locally
- Run tests on feature branches

## Benefits:

- Debug a failing test locally
- Validate a new test scenario before pushing
