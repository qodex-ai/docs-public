title: "Running on Schedule (via Test Plans)"

You can automate test execution using **Test Plans**:

## Steps:

1. Go to **Test Plans**
2. Create or edit a Plan
3. Choose:
   - Which Test Suites to run
   - When to run:
     - Daily
     - Weekly
     - On Deploy
     - Custom (cron-style)
4. Set up notifications (Slack, Email, Webhook)
5. Save the Plan — Qodex will now run the tests automatically at the defined times.

## Why

- Continuous monitoring of API health
- Catches regressions over time — even when no new code is deployed
- Validates staging environments daily
- Helps teams ensure uptime and coverage
