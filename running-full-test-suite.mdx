title: "Running Full Test Suite"
---

A **Test Suite** is a group of related test scenarios â€” for example:

- Regression suite
- Auth flow tests
- Payment APIs
- Core user flows

## Steps:

1. Go to **Test Suites**
2. Select the desired suite
3. Click **Run**

## What happens:

- All scenarios in the suite are executed
- Results are shown per test case
- You get a combined Build Report

This is the best way to validate large parts of your API with one command.
