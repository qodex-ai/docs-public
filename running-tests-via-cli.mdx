title: "Running Tests via CLI (Local)"
---

For developers who want to run tests locally — before pushing code — Qodex provides CLI support.

## Steps:

1. Sync your test cases to GitHub (via **Sync to GitHub**)
2. Clone the GitHub repo locally
3. Set up an .env file with environment variables (staging, prod, etc.)
4. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   qodex test run --env=.env.staging
   ```

## What this allows:

- Running tests during local dev
- Validating API changes before PRs
- Quickly debugging failed tests
- Testing branches before merges
