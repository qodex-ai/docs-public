title: "Using Manual + AI Flow Together"
---

Qodex is flexible â€” you can use **AI \+ Manual flow** together:

## Typical Flow:

1. Start by creating a test scenario with AI
2. Review generated test cases
3. Edit any test case manually
4. Add new manual test cases if needed
5. Re-generate request data or test rules anytime
6. Add advanced DB validations for critical flows

## Benefits:

- Speed of AI generation
- Full control for edge cases
- Ability to maintain tests as APIs evolve
- Consistent test format (AI \+ manual cases look the same)
- Easy to collaborate across Dev and QA teams
