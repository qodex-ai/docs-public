APIs are everywhere ‚Äî and so are the vulnerabilities.

Most security breaches today aren‚Äôt caused by obscure zero-days ‚Äî they happen because basic API security tests weren‚Äôt automated, and common flaws slipped into production.

That‚Äôs why one of the most powerful things [Qodex.ai](http://Qodex.ai) does is automatically generate **OWASP Top-10 API security tests**for you ‚Äî with no manual scripting required.

In this post, we‚Äôll cover **10 key OWASP tests** Qodex can generate and run ‚Äî helping your team stay ahead of risks.

## **How Qodex Works**

With [Qodex.ai](http://Qodex.ai), you can simply tell the AI:

> _‚ÄúRun OWASP security tests on my APIs‚Äù_

> _‚ÄúCheck for broken access control and IDOR‚Äù_

The platform will:

- Analyze your API endpoints
- Generate dozens of relevant test scenarios
- Validate common and advanced security risks
- Alert you on failures ‚Äî before they hit production

## **The Top 10 OWASP Tests Qodex Auto-Generates**

 1. **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)**

    **Test for:**
    - Whether one user can access or modify another user‚Äôs data (IDOR)
    - Lack of proper auth checks on object references
 2. **Broken User Authentication**

    **Test for:**
    - Missing or weak authentication
    - Token reuse and token expiration
    - Insecure password reset or session management
 3. **Excessive Data Exposure**

    **Test for:**
    - APIs returning too much data (internal fields, sensitive attributes)
    - Lack of field filtering or proper response shaping
 4. **Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting**

    **Test for:**
    - Missing rate limiting
    - DoS vectors ‚Äî abuse of expensive endpoints
    - Brute-force attack surfaces
 5. **Broken Function Level Authorization**

    **Test for:**
    - Lack of permission checks on admin functions
    - Horizontal/vertical privilege escalation
 6. **Mass Assignment**

    **Test for:**
    - APIs accepting unexpected fields in request bodies
    - Ability to manipulate hidden server-side fields
 7. **Security Misconfiguration**

    **Test for:**
    - Missing or incorrect HTTP headers
    - Verbose error messages exposing stack traces
    - Misconfigured CORS
 8. **Injection Flaws**

    **Test for:**
    - SQL injection in parameters or body
    - NoSQL injection
    - Command injection
    - Path traversal
 9. **Improper Assets Management**

    **Test for:**
    - Exposed old API versions
    - Deprecated but accessible endpoints
    - Lack of proper version control in APIs
10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**

    **Test for:**
    - Lack of audit trails
    - No alerting on abnormal behavior
    - No coverage for failed auth attempts or privilege escalations

## **Why Qodex Help**

- You don‚Äôt need to write these tests yourself
- You don‚Äôt need a dedicated security engineer
- You can **embed OWASP security testing into your CI/CD**
- You get visibility \+ alerts BEFORE vulnerabilities get shipped
