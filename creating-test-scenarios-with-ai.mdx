**Creating Test Scenarios with AI** is the fastest way to build automated API tests in Qodex.

You don’t need to write scripts — just tell the AI what you want to test, in plain English.

## How it Works

1. **Go to AI Agent**

   This is the main landing page when you log in at [app.qodex.ai/ai-agent](https://app.qodex.ai/ai-agent).
2. **Start a chat with the AI**

   In the chat box, describe what you want to test.

   **Example prompts:**
   - Test login flow with valid and invalid credentials
   - Verify new user registration and token creation
   - Check token expiration and re-authentication
   - Run OWASP Top 10 tests on all protected APIs
   - Validate payment flow end-to-end
3. **AI will generate your test scenario**

   The AI will automatically:
   - Identify which API endpoints to test
   - Create a Test Scenario with one or more test cases
   - Chain related API calls together (if needed)
   - Generate request data for each test
   - Write suggested test rules to validate behavior
   - Identify any dependencies (auth tokens, object creation)
4. **You can review and edit**
   - Modify test names or descriptions
   - Adjust request data (or re-generate)
   - Edit test rules — add your own or pick from AI suggestions
   - Add extra test cases if needed
5. **Save your Test Scenario**
   - Once saved, the scenario will appear under the **Test Scenarios** tab
   - You can run it manually, schedule it, or add it to a Test Plan
